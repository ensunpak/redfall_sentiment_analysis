### <p>Project description</p>
This project aims to examine the trend of sentiment on Twitter related to the video game Redfall developed by
[Arkane Studios](https://bethesda.net/en/game/redfall).
The tweets used in this project were scraped and classified with a sentiment (positive, neutral and negative) using unsupervised methods.
To classify new tweets outside a select number of classification algorithms were developed and results were cross-validated with K-Folds to
determine the best model for use in this project.
